Well, never mind about your big blue eyes
Never mind about your little white lies
Never mind about the way you cheat at me
But girl, I'll always love you, you will see

That I'll never love another than your caress
Never ever worry about all the rest
Never ever worry you can act untrue
'Cause baby, baby, baby, I'm in love with you

Can you remember when you broke a date and nearly broke my heart
Can you remember how it feels when you're passing those remarks

Well, I've never, never, never, never ever mind
You carryin' on lying and you act unkind
If I tell you conselation, baby, you will find
It won't be me who's saying, never mind
