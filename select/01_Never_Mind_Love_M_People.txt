I played out this scene before too
Many times.
I walked across the crowded room
And looked him in the eye.
He looked up to me and said
Would I lie to you
But he didn't know what I know,
What I'm going to do
So go to hell now
'Cause I don't care for you.
I don't need you
You're a stone in my shoe.
You think I'm stupid
Well I got news for you.
I ain't no cupid
And so I say to you

Never mind my never never love.
Never mind my never never love.
I say never mind my never never love.
Never mind my never never love.

How you gonna change the habit
Of a lifetime overnight.
You think you're so immortal,
So eternal, out of sight.
The questions I am gonna ask
Aren't the ones you wanna hear.
Alone inside your narrow mind
Now let's get one thing clear
Unlike Sinatra
You ain't under my skin.
What can I tell ya
Don't know where to begin.
Can't find your heart now
But who's lookin' anyway.
Hasta luego
Adios I'm on my way
