The sun is rising
And it's shining down on me
Rainbows in the air
And rainbows in the sea

Rain is falling
And the water still tastes right
A close look at your watch
It's right before midnight

CHORUS
Never mind - see the rainbow in the sky
Never mind - don't you ever wonder why

Catch the starlight
Find a hole up in the sky
Chasing clouds for a sunset
Ain't worth a try

Lost horizons
You know we turned the wheel too fast
Who will pay the price
When this time is past

'Cause we are children of the earth
In the dead of the night
Many eyes will cry

CHORUS
